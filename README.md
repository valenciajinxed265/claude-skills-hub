## What is this?

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) supports **custom slash commands** — reusable skill files that turn Claude into a specialized expert for any task. This repo is the **largest curated collection** of these skills, organized by domain.

Each skill is a `.md` file you place into your `.claude/commands/` folder. Then type `/skill-name` in Claude Code and it activates.

---

## How to Use

**1.** Click the **Star** button to support the project, then click **Fork** to get your own copy.

**2.** Open any skill file from the categories below, copy its contents, and create a new `.md` file in your Claude commands folder:

```
~/.claude/commands/skill-name.md        # Global (works in all projects)
your-project/.claude/commands/skill-name.md  # Project-level (works in that project only)
```

**3.** Use it in Claude Code by typing `/skill-name`:

```
> /frontend-design
> /security-audit
> /unit-test
```

**4.** Sync your fork regularly to get new skills as they're added.

> **License:** [CC BY 4.0](LICENSE) — You must credit this repo and [@ShadmanSakibRahman](https://github.com/ShadmanSakibRahman) when using or sharing these skills. Every skill file contains an attribution comment — please keep it intact.
